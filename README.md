**[DEMO](https://tweetableapp.herokuapp.com/)**

## Description
Only logged users can create, edit and destroy their own Tweets and Comments. Not logged users can only read the list of Tweets and the list of comments for each Tweet.
## Getting started
1. First clone this repo with
docker container run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -v ssh:/root/.ssh codeableorg/git clone {the ssh goes here}

2. Go to the directory and create a file with the .env extension and add this format
```
GIT_USER_NAME=NameHERE
GIT_USER_EMAIL=your_github_mail@goes.here
DB_HOST=test_bsale-xxxx_db_1
```
The DB_HOST will be setted later when you run the #3

3. Run docker first
```
docker-compose up
```
4. On a different window run:
 ```
 docker compose exec client bash
 ```
5. Inside the bash terminal run the command:
 ```
bootstrap 
 ```
6. Go to your .env file and fill the DB_HOST variable with your db_host from step 3
7. Install all the gems with bundle install
8. Initialize your DB: rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
9. Finally you can run this command to open rails server
```
rails s -b 0.0.0.0
```
10. Go to your browser and to this site. And enjoy it
```
http://localhost:3000
```

11. If you got any problems booting the server or creating the db you can repeat from number 3 or verify the environment variables. That's it. Thanks for enjoying this app.
